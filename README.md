### To setup this project you need:

* to have two virtual hosts (one for frontend and another for backend);
* the database file is in “/backend/db.sql”;
* you also need apache2 web server, php7, PDO module, and mod_rewrite module;
* you need to change the database connection in the config.php (in “backend” folder);

To see the database you can use backendHostname/adminer.php (easier to navigate than via phpMyAdmin).

**For developing**, you would need to install npm and modules listed in package.json.
